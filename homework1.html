  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am passionate about learning, I believe the biggest help one can give another person is to teach
    them how to learn by themselves.<br> As I mentioned before, I consider myself a fast learner, however, it
    is not because I have an innane ability to learn, but rather because<br> of the tools and resources I use.
  </p>
  <p>As previouosly stated, I am a Math and Physics tutor, however I was once a student as well.<br> 
    In order to learn math, I studied from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA" target="_blank">
    The Organic Chemistry Tutor</a>, who does not only teach Organic Chemistry.<br> Whenever I need to refresh 
    my physics skills, my favorite teacher is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYqACVYl0c0BhlVN6X2HIMg" target="_blank">
    Flipping Physics</a>. Thanks to him, I was able to <br>pass <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-physics-1-algebra-based" target="_blank">
      AP Physics</a> as well as learn the necessary information needed to tutor students.

it is not reccommended to expand it as it spans about 60 lines of code. Also, I know the instructions said not to style anything
but I styled a border around the table so that it wouldn't look so strange-->
